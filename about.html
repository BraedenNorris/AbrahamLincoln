								<h3>Life Before Presidency</h3>
								<p>Abraham Lincoln grew up on a single log cabin near Nolin Creek in Kentucky. He grew up learning by reading books. Lincoln moved and lived in the 3 states of Kentucky, Indiana, then Illinois.</p>

								<p>Abraham Lincoln was elected to become a captain in the Blackhawk war. He then met his wife, Mary Todd while working in Springfield, IL. Then, on November 4 of 1842 Lincoln married to Mary Todd. The Lincolnâ€™s then had four children, Robert, Edward, William, and Thomas. Unfortunately Edward died in 1850 and William died in 1862. In 1858 Lincoln ran against the Democratic Stephen Douglas for US Senator to Illinois and lost.</p>

								<h4>A meessage from the president</h4>
								<p>"There are those who are dissatisfied with me. To such I would say: You desire peace; and you blame me that we do not have it. But how can we attain it? There are but three conceivable ways. First, to suppress the rebellion by force of arms. This I am trying to do. Are you for it? If you are, so far we are agreed. If you are not for it, a second way is to give up the Union. I am against this. Are you for it? If you are, you should say so plainly. If you are not for force, nor yet for dissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise. I do not believe any compromise, embracing the maintenance of the Union, is now possible. All I learn, leads to a directly opposite belief. The strength of the rebellion, is its military--its army. That army dominates all the country, and all the people, within its range. Any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that army, is simply nothing for the present; because such man or men, have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made with them. To illustrate. Suppose refugees from the South, and peace men of the North, get together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the Union; in what way can that compromise be used to keep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania? Meade's army can keep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania; and I think, can ultimately drive it out of existence. But no paper compromise, to which the controllers of Lee's army are not agreed, can at all affect that army. In an effort at such compromise we should waste time, which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage; and that would be all. A compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who control the rebel army, or with the people first liberated from the domination of that army, by the success of our own army. Now allow me to assure you, that no word or intimation, from that rebel army, or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to any peace compromise, has ever come to my knowledge or belief. All charges and insinuations to the contrary, are deceptive and groundless. And I promise you, that if any such proposition shall hereafter come, it shall not be rejected, and kept a secret from you. I freely acknowledge myself the servant of the people, according to the bond of service--the United States Constitution; and that, as such, I am responsible to them."<br/ >
